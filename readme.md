This will be a site that will ask potential costumers their preferences and based on that will suggest highly rated places on Morelia that will fit their needs. 

It removes the need for discovery in social media.

The type of questions that it might ask are maybe:

+ What kind of food do you like
+ Loud or music to talk
+ Cheap or Expensive
+ I want to be surprised or go to a sure thing
+ Etc. 

It could be a glorified form. But with the right design, UX and UI we can make a site that it will actually drive costumers to the right place. A kind of router, that drives traffic according to the preferences, it could even ask after the visit if the recommendation was according to the expectations. 

Here we could make a profit by giving tons of traffic to the site using a pool of the people paying for the service in this way we leverage the traffic of all social media to a smart traffic light that moves people to the right location. 

Yes, we have tiktok, facebook, instagram and other places that put all restaurants to fight for the attention of users, while not being very efficient, because is a zero sum game. Also the tools are not made especially for a city with our necesities like Morelia. Instead is a general tool.
Here we have a chance to pool the resources of all our clients and suggest to costumers places that they will actually like. 

Currently there is a problem where small, new places in Morelia don't get traffic, this will level the field and if the site is good, we might give it a boost in the ratings. 

We could use smart algos to place sites and even charge them only on people clicking in their actual listings. Who knows. Or Maybe charge to put the profile of their restaurant with more detail than the rest. 

Here the potential for profit lies in the cost to the traffic to the site and the effect we cause in the restaurant of the client. 

Even if the results that they drive with direct ads on social media, I think we can frame it in a way that sounds like another source of costumers. 

I would be interested in paying for the site, as a restaurant owner, if I saw it with life. I mean, proof that people is actually using it, with comments and others signals of activity. Even pay for it around $600-$800 mxn per month only to see if it works. 
We could leverage the fact that many places don't even track where costumers come from.
